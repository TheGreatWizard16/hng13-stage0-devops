## 🧾 Project Description
This repository contains my submission for the **HNG13 DevOps Stage 0** challenge.  
The goal of this task is to demonstrate basic **DevOps deployment skills** by:

- Setting up and configuring an **NGINX web server**  
- Hosting a **custom HTML page** accessible from the internet  
- Managing workflow and documentation through **GitHub**

## ⚙️ Deployment Details
**Server IP/Domain:** _To be added after deployment_  
**Hosting Platform:** _To be added after deployment_  
**Deployment Date:** _To be added after deployment_

## 🧩 Steps Performed
1. Forked the official repository: `hng13-stage0-devops`
2. Created and updated this `README.md` with personal information
3. Edited `index.html` to include:
Welcome to DevOps Stage 0 - Segun Oladimeji / @SegunO
Successfully deployed on [Platform Name]
Deployed: [Date]
4. Installed and configured **NGINX** on a cloud VPS
5. Replaced the default NGINX page with the custom HTML file
6. Ensured the server is publicly accessible on port **80**

## ✅ Expected Output
Visiting  
👉 `http://your-server-ip/`  
should display:
Welcome to DevOps Stage 0 - Segun Oladimeji / @SegunO

## 📌 Notes
- Only **port 80** is allowed (no alternative ports).  
- Server must remain **live until grading is complete**.  
- HTML content must be visible when accessed publicly.
